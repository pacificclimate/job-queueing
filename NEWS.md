# News / Release Notes

## 0.1.0

*2017 Aug 21*

* Initial release of jobqueueing scripts as a separate project.
* Previous "releases" were part of [CE backend](https://github.com/pacificclimate/climate-explorer-backend)
  but those releases were not specific to jobqueueing and did not document it.
* A >90% solar eclipse occurred today in Victoria, B.C. This probably does not affect the software.
